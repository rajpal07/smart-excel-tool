1. Identifying Rules (Parsing)
------------------------------------------------
The app looks at every cell in the "Threshold Rows" you selected (e.g., Rows 14, 17, 20).
For each cell, it performs these steps:

Clean Up:
  It strips out noisy characters like %,    ,  *,  #,  S,  sat,  a.
  Example: "1,500" becomes "1500"
  Example: "80% S" becomes "80"

Detect Type:
  - Range (X - Y): If it sees two numbers separated by a dash (e.g., 6.5-8.5), it creates a Range Rule.
    (Your value must be between these numbers).
  - Explicit Signs (< or >):
    < 5: Creates a Less Than rule (Target must be below 5).
    > 5: Creates a Greater Than rule (Target must be above 5).
  - Implicit (Just a Number):
    If the cell just says "400" (and it's a pollutant column), the app assumes it is a Minimum Threshold.
    Rule Created: "Value must be STRICTLY Greater Than 400" (not equal to).

------------------------------------------------

2. Coloring Logic (The "Battle" for Color)
------------------------------------------------
When checking a specific data value (e.g., 1500 or 5630) against the rules:

Parsing:
  The data value "1,500" is cleaned to 1500.0 (This was the bug I fixed).

Find Matches:
  The app finds ALL rules that this value satisfies.
  Example for Chloride (Value 1500):
    Rule 1 (Row 14, Value 1):   > 1?   YES
    Rule 2 (Row 17, Value 350): > 350? YES
    Rule 3 (Row 20, Value 400): > 400? YES

Pick Winner (Priority):
  Since multiple rules match, the app picks the Highest Threshold.
  Logic: "If it exceeds 400, that is 'worse' (or more specific) than exceeding 1."
  Winner: > 400 (Row 20 Color).
